# Goal

Most migrants and refugees arriving in Europe cross the Mediterranean.

The purpose of this website is to provide a rough overview by focusing mainly on the Central Mediterranean and by covering both maritime and political events.

## History

This project succeeds [bb](https://github.com/barbalex/bb) and [bb2](https://github.com/barbalex/bb2).

It is being rebuilt from the ground up to:

- Learn new, promising technologies.
- Improve visitor's experience.
- Improve the editor's experience.
- Improve the developer's experience.

## Technologies

### [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io)

- Instantly-interactive web app.
- Query, mutate and massage data server side.<br/>
  Goodbye data fetching API. Just wow.
- State management with signals. Beats even mobx.
- Only render what's on screen.
- Simpler yet more powerfull than React.

### [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)<br/>

A "utility-first" CSS framework. Whatever that means. But I am starting to like it.
